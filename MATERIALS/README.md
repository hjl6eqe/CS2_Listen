Included in this folder are both a link to the code for the project and articles to help guide your analysis. Do not open the code file until you are finished with the case study yourself. In addition, you should wait to view the cleaned data until you have attempted to download and clean the variables you deem most appropriate or interesting for predicting a recession first.

The uploaded code and data should just serve as a reference point after you perform your analysis.
